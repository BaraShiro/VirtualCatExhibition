# Virtual Cat Exhibition

An art exhibition showcasing 3D artworks I made of my cats, with accompanying information about the cats.

## Download

A compiled binary for Windows is available from the [Releases][release] page.

## Build

To build the project, clone the repo, and then download and import [Spatialograph Maker][spatialograph] into the project.
Only Windows desktop builds are supported, as the gaussian splat shader does not run on Mac, mobile, or WebGL.
